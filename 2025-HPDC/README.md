# HPDC 2025 Tutorial

This directory contains the materials for the HPDC 2025 tutorial. The following subsections go over the contains of the material.

## Tutorial Code

The code elements of this tutorial (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, command-line scripts, Markdown/RST instruction files) can all be found in the `tutorial-code` subdirectory. If materials are actually stored in other git repositories, they can be accessed from this subdirectory
via a git submodule.

## Slides

The slides used in presenting this tutorial can be found in the `slides` subdirectory.

## Docker

The Docker definition files (i.e., Dockerfiles) for all the necessary containers can be found in the `docker` subdirectory. There are currently 5 definition files:
1. `Dockerfile.caliper`: builds Caliper and Adiak on top of the `ubuntu/noble` image from DockerHub
2. `Dockerfile.thicket`: build Thicket on top of the image produced by `Dockerfile.caliper`
3. `Dockerfile.benchpark`: download and bootstrap Benchpark on top of the image produced by `Dockerfile.benchpark`
4. `Dockerfile.spawn`: download tutorial materials, download any remaining necessary packages, and do other setup work on top of the image produced by `Dockerfile.benchpark`
5. `Dockerfile.init`: ensure user permissions are correct using the super-minimal `alpine/git` image from DockerHub

## Infrastructure

All the infrastructure needed to deploy the tutorial to a Kubernetes cluster with JupyterHub is contained in the `infrastructure` subdirectory. This infrastructure is generated by the tool [here](https://lc.llnl.gov/gitlab/lumsden1/hpcic-k8s-configurer). The infrastructure can be regenerated as-is using `infrastructure/config.toml`.
