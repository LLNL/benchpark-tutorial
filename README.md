# benchpark-tutorial

A repo containing container definition files for the 2025 HPDC Tutorial titled:
"Reproducible Performance Measurement and Analysis for High-Performance Computing Applications".

Notes:
* Consider creating a general benchpark container that installs benchpark to something like `/opt/benchpark` and bootstraps. If we do this, rework the spawn container to be based on it.
